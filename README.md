This is a feature pre-training code release of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03615):

```
For more sustained maintenance, we release code using [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) instead of [mask-rcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) which the original code is based on. The current repository should reproduce the results reported in the paper, *e.g.*, reporting **~72.5** single model VQA score for a X-101 backbone paired with [MCAN](https://github.com/MILVLG/mcan-vqa)-large.

## Installation
Install Detectron 2 following [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Since Detectron 2 is also being actively updated which can result in breaking behaviors, it is **highly recommended** to install via the following command:
```bash
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git@ffff8ac'
```
Commits before or after `ffff8ac` might also work, but it could be risky.
Then clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/grid-feats-vqa.git
cd grid-feats-vqa
```

## Data
[Visual Genome](http://visualgenome.org/) `train+val` splits released from the bottom-up-attention [code](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) are used for pre-training, and `test` split is used for evaluating detection performance. All of them are prepared in [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/) format but include an additional field for `attribute` prediction. We provide the `.json` files [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/grid-feats-vqa/json/visual_genome.tgz) which can be directly loaded by Detectron2. Same as in Detectron2, the expected dataset structure under the `DETECTRON2_DATASETS` (default is `./datasets` relative to your current working directory) folder should be:
```
visual_genome/
  annotations/
    visual_genome_{train,val,test}.json
  images/
    # visual genome images (~108K)
```

## Training
Once the dataset is setup, to train a model, run (by default we use 8 GPUs):
```bash
python train_net.py --num-gpus 8 --config-file <config.yaml>
```
For example, to launch grid-feature pre-training with ResNet-50 backbone on 8 GPUs, one should execute:
```bash
python train_net.py --num-gpus 8 --config-file configs/R-50-grid.yaml
```
The final model by default should be saved under `./output` of your current working directory once it is done training. We also provide the region-feature pre-training configuration `configs/R-50-updn.yaml` for reference. Note that we use `0.2` attribute loss (`MODEL.ROI_ATTRIBUTE_HEAD.LOSS_WEIGHT = 0.2`), which is better for down-stream tasks like VQA per our analysis.

We also release the configuration (`configs/R-50-updn.yaml`) for training the region features described in **bottom-up-attention** paper, which is a faithful re-implementation of the original [one](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) in Detectron2.

## Feature Extraction

### Grid Features

Grid feature extraction can be done by simply running once the model is trained (or you can directly download our pre-trained models, see below):
```bash
python extract_grid_feature.py -config-file configs/R-50-grid.yaml --dataset <dataset>
```
and the code will load the final model from `cfg.OUTPUT_DIR` (which one can override in command line) and start extracting features for `<dataset>`, we provide three options for the dataset: `coco_2014_train`, `coco_2014_val` and `coco_2015_test`, they correspond to `train`, `val` and `test` splits of the VQA dataset. The extracted features can be conveniently loaded in [MMF](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf).

To extract features on your customized dataset, you may want to dump the image information into [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/) `.json` format, and add the dataset information to use `extract_grid_feature.py`, or you can hack `extract_grid_feature.py` and directly loop over images.

### Region Features

For extracting region features use the `extract_region_feature.py` script, run:

```bash
python extract_region_feature.py --config-file configs/X-152-region-c4.yaml --dataset <dataset>
```

The code will load the final model from `cfg.OUTPUT_DIR`. You can also specify a path to the images folder of your dataset directly, by running:

```bash
python extract_region_feature.py \
  --config-file configs/X-152-region-c4.yaml \
  --dataset <dataset_name> \
  --dataset-path <path_to_dataset_images_dir>
```

The features are saved in `.npy` format which is a dictionary containing these fields:

```json
{
  "bbox": ,
  "num_boxes": ,
  "objects": ,
  "image_height": ,
  "image_width": ,
  "cls_prob": ,
  "features": ,
}

```

`bbox` contains all the extracted bounding boxes, `cls_prob` contains the class probabilities of `objects` present in the bounding boxes, `features` contain the extracted features of each bounding box.

## Pre-Trained Models and Features
We release several pre-trained models for grid features: one with R-50 backbone, one with X-101, one with X-152, and one with additional improvements used for the 2020 VQA Challenge (see `X-152-challenge.yaml`). The models can be used directly to extract features. For your convenience, we also release the pre-extracted features for direct download.
